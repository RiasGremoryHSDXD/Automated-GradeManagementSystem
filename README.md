# Automated Grade Management System: Enhancing Effiiency in Academic Assessment for Instant Analysis

It aims to enhance efficiency in academic assessment by providing instant analysis of student grades. The system allows users to input student details, including email and password for authentication. Once authenticated, users can perform various actions such as adding student records, viewing existing records, and ending the program.

The system captures information such as student names, subject grades (Introduction to Computing, Programmer, Purposive Communication, Reading in Philippine History, The Contemporary World), calculates the average, and determines if the student has passed or failed based on a threshold of 70%.

The code includes functions for alphabet validation, concatenation of student names, and digit validation to ensure the correctness of input data.

This project could be useful for educational institutions, teachers, or administrators who want a simple and automated way to manage and analyze student grades
